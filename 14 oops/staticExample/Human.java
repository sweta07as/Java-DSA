package oops2.staticExample;

//properties that are not directly related/ dependent on the objects
//but common to all the objects of the class
//are called static properties (i.e., static variables or static methods).
//To access Static variables, name of the Class is used instead of "this" keyword

//When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created,
//and without reference to any object. You can declare both methods and variables to be static.

//Static member in Java is a member which belongs to the class and not to the object.
